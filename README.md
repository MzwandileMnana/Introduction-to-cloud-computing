Notes for introduction to cloud computing course

There are three primary cloud service models, often summarized as:

1. IaaS â€“ Infrastructure as a Service
âœ… Functionality:

Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet such as:

Virtual machines (VMs)

Storage

Networks

Load balancers

Firewalls

ðŸ”§ Use Case:

Developers or IT admins want to build and manage their own applications without buying physical hardware.

ðŸ§© Examples:

Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2

Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines

Google Compute Engine

ðŸ“Œ Key Features:

Full control over the OS and applications

Scalable resources on demand

Pay-as-you-go pricing

2. PaaS â€“ Platform as a Service
âœ… Functionality:

Provides a ready-to-use platform for developing, testing, and deploying applications without worrying about infrastructure management.

ðŸ”§ Use Case:

Developers want to focus only on writing code without managing the underlying OS, storage, or servers.

ðŸ§© Examples:

Google App Engine

Microsoft Azure App Services

Heroku

ðŸ“Œ Key Features:

Managed runtime environment

Built-in tools for development and deployment

Faster time to market

3. SaaS â€“ Software as a Service

Microsoft 365

Salesforce

Dropbox

ðŸ“Œ Key Features:

Accessible from any device with internet

No software installation required

Maintenance and updates handled by provider
